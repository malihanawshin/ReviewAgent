**Status:** APPROVE

**Summary:** The code change introduces a `StripePaymentProcessor` class that interacts with an `OrderRepository` to process payments. The code is straightforward, with a low complexity score of 2, which is well below the threshold of 10. The automated analysis has passed, and the code follows existing patterns as seen in the project context. The use of a `Protocol` for `OrderRepository` is appropriate for defining the expected interface without enforcing a specific implementation.

**Critical Issues:**
- None

**Suggestions:**
- Consider replacing the `print` statements with a proper logging mechanism to ensure consistency with production-level code and to facilitate better debugging and monitoring.
- Ensure that the `Order` class from `pos.order` has an `id` attribute, as it is used in the `process_payment` method. This is assumed to be correct based on the context, but it should be verified.
- It might be beneficial to include a timeout or retry mechanism in the `connect_to_service` method to handle potential connectivity issues more gracefully.
