**Status:** REQUEST_CHANGES

**Summary:** The code provided is a Python script that implements a command-line interface for encoding, decoding, and hashing text using various algorithms. While the automated analysis indicates a pass with a complexity score of 5, there are several issues and improvements needed for correctness, maintainability, and consistency.

**Critical Issues:**
- **Error Handling:** The code lacks proper error handling. For instance, if an invalid command is entered, the program should handle it gracefully rather than potentially causing a runtime error.
- **Variable Name Error:** In the `hashVal` method, there is a reference to `DecoderName` instead of `HasherName` in the error message, which is misleading and incorrect.
- **Inconsistent Use of Print Statements:** The code uses print statements for user feedback, which is not ideal for a library or tool that might be used in different environments. Consider using logging for better control over output.
- **Exit Functionality:** The `Exit` method uses `exit(0)`, which is not recommended for scripts that might be imported as modules. Consider raising a custom exception or using `sys.exit()`.

**Suggestions:**
- **Improve Documentation:** The docstrings and comments could be more detailed, explaining the purpose and usage of each method and class.
- **Refactor for Maintainability:** Consider breaking down the `Interface` class into smaller, more focused classes or functions to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Use of Type Hints:** While some type hints are present, ensure they are used consistently throughout the code to improve readability and help with static analysis.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Ensure that all variable and method names follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., snake_case for variables and methods).
- **Testing:** Ensure that there are adequate tests for all functionalities, especially for edge cases and error conditions.

Overall, while the code is functional, addressing these issues will improve its robustness and maintainability.
