**Status:** APPROVE

**Summary:**
The code change introduces a script for training a Decision Tree Classifier on a dataset related to stress levels. The script includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the model and label encoder. Additionally, it attempts to export the model to ONNX format if the necessary library is available. The automated analysis indicates a low complexity score, and the analyst verdict is a pass. The code follows existing patterns observed in the project context, ensuring consistency and maintainability.

**Critical Issues:**
- None identified. The code is consistent with the existing project context and follows standard practices for machine learning model training and evaluation.

**Suggestions:**
- Consider adding logging instead of using print statements for better tracking and debugging in production environments.
- Ensure that the dataset file path ("StressLevelDataset.csv") is correctly configured and accessible in the deployment environment.
- It might be beneficial to include exception handling around the data loading and model training sections to gracefully handle potential errors, such as file not found or data format issues.
- If the ONNX export is a critical feature, consider adding a note in the documentation or requirements to ensure `skl2onnx` is installed in the environment.
