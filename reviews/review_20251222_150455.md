- Project: /Users/maliha/Desktop/CodeCarbon CLI Tool
- File: codecarbon_cli_tool.py

---

**Status:** APPROVE

**Summary:** The submitted code introduces a command-line interface (CLI) tool that utilizes the CodeCarbon library to measure and log the carbon emissions of a Python script. The code is well-structured, follows existing patterns, and has passed the automated analysis with a low complexity score. The code is consistent with the project context and does not introduce any unnecessary complexity or deviations from existing patterns.

**Critical Issues:**
- None identified. The code is straightforward and adheres to the project's existing structure and practices.

**Suggestions:**
- Consider adding more detailed error handling or logging to capture and report any issues that might occur during the execution of the script. This could help in diagnosing problems more effectively.
- It might be beneficial to include a README or additional documentation to guide users on how to use the CLI tool, including any prerequisites or setup steps required for the CodeCarbon library.
- If the tool is intended for broader use, consider adding unit tests to ensure the functionality remains robust as the project evolves.
